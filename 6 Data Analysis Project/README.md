# Data Analysis Project
In this module, we will learn ways to analyze data to create meaningful business reports based on that data, as well as handle errors gracefully.

**NOTE: Do Not Turn In Lesssons. These are for building your foundation to complete the exercises and activities**

## Lessons
By the end of this course, participants will be able to build a python foundation by following these lesson:

- [Lab: Importing and Exporting Data with Pandas](https://academy.engagelms.com/mod/resource/view.php?id=147958)
- [Lab: Working with Pandas](https://academy.engagelms.com/mod/resource/view.php?id=147953&forceview=1)
- [Lab: Working with NumPy](â€‹https://academy.engagelms.com/mod/resource/view.php?id=147956&forceview=1)


## TURN IN ASSIGNMENTS
The assignment for Python are jupyter notbooks provided to you. You will turn in your notebooks in the appropciate sections. **Turn in** your  *Activities*, *Exercises*, and *Self Assessment* code in the 

Below are the assignments to turn in. Add your Jupyter Notebooks from the following lessons:

### Activities
- [Lesson: Visualization Tutorial](https://academy.engagelms.com/mod/page/view.php?id=147405) (Practice: Line Chart, Histograms, Pie Charts, Creating Multiple Visualizaations)

### Self Assessment (Group)
- [ETL Tutorial](https://academy.engagelms.com/mod/page/view.php?id=147406)

### Group Activity
- [Group Assessment: Data Analysis Project](https://academy.engagelms.com/mod/page/view.php?id=147403)
- **GOAL** The goal of data analysis is to take a large pool of raw data and transform it into a meaningful dataset that allows users to make business decisions based on the data

In your team create an original project to present with the following criteria:

- Identify the goal of the project.
- Identify an existing dataset that contains data appropriate for the goal (use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Google Datasets Search](https://research.google/resources/datasets/), etc).
- Transform the data as necessary to meet the goal.
- Create a report that the end user can use to make decisions based on the data.

**My Challenge: Extra Assessment**: *Personal/Relative Datap* - Find data as a team that relates to all of you and can be useful to match the goal. (hint: use real life things, housing costs, food, entertainment, etc if you can find a dataset to match the teams goal). **NOTE:** Be creative

**REQUIREMENTS**

- Create an ETL
- Use the following charts: *Line Plot, Line Chart, Histogram Plot, Scatter Plot, Pie Charts, 1 Combination of at least 2 visuals*
- Use pandas
- Use numPy for calculations
- Use the Agile SDLC. Conduct daily stand ups
- Create a presentation for the class showcasing your goal and team data analysis
- Each teammate must present to the class
